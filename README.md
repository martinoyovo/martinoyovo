Hi, I'm a software engineer, public speaker, and content creator passionate about empowering developers globally through innovative solutions and educational content. I specialize in modern web, mobile technologies, and AI integrations, creating tutorials, demos, and sample applications that help developers build delightful, seamless experiences with cutting-edge tools.

With years of engineering and advocacy experience, I've worked on diverse projects ranging from enterprise applications to open-source tools. I create high-quality technical contentâ€”including blog posts, videos, and code samplesâ€”that inspires the developer community. I believe in clean code, thoughtful design, and actively engaging with local and global developer ecosystems to provide the tools, resources, and support developers need to succeed.
